	<div class="callout-text">
<p>
Adding to my 7 years of experience in <em>multimedia production</em>, I also have professional experience in <em>digital communications</em>.
<br>
My 2 year experience includes web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build, maintaian and improve professional webpages with optimisation for any type of device.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I also have a passion for media production (Film & Events) but a few years ago I was invited to a filming of 8 out of 10 cats at Pinewood Studios, met and talked to friends in the TV industry and been a part of a couple TV projects which has given me an insight in TV production that has motivated me to look beyond some of the practical and logistical issues I had initially.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will always enjoy studio productions and will feel comfortable in that environment because I volunteer as Director/Vision Mixer in a Tech/Media team that broadcasts a live feed in-house and online every Sunday. However I’ve seen bigger TV productions on main channels championing people with an extraordinary story and I think that’s great for many people from different communities, a couple of which I’m a part of, which is why I’d like to develop and get experience in producing unique, engaging content on TV and online.
